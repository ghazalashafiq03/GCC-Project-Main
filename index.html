<h1>1. Coffee Shop </h1>
<p>
When you think of your neighborhood coffee shop , you might not think of the same establishment. But if your town is small enough, and clientele scarce, merging these two business ideas might be just what the mayor ordered.

<h1>2. Clothing Boutique </h1>
<p>
One of the primary amenities that small towns tend to lack is decent shopping. And we don’t just mean a large shopping mall. Often, those living in smaller towns and communities have to drive significant mileage just for basic clothing necessities. That’s why starting a clothing boutique will not only put you on the map but will make you a popular destination for most residents in the vicinity. You’ll pretty much be the mall substitute for all things teen-related. Just make sure to stay up-to-date on the latest trends. But they’ll let you know if you don’t

<h1>3. Bakery </h1>
<p>
From your morning coffee to your kid’s birthday cake, neighborhood bakeries can fill a vast number of potential small-town needs. Though owning and operating a bakery is hard work, if it’s your life-long dream to produce pastries for the masses, it’s a business idea that can be incredibly rewarding. Employing youth from your town is also a great way to give back and stay connected to your

<h1>4. Car Wash </h1>
<p>
Whether a small town is in North Dakota, Upstate New York, or South Florida, one thing is for sure: people prefer shiny modes of transportation to muddy, rusty wrecks. It’s just how human nature works. You pay your car payment every month, so your vehicle might as well shine! If there isn’t a car wash in your town already or at least one in the next town over, opening a cash wash might be your perfect small town business opportunity. One thing to think about before getting started: location, location, location. Nail this stage of the planning and you’ll make the rest of your ride significantly easier.

<h1>5. Gift Card Shop</h1>
<p>
Americans purchase on average 6.5 billion greeting cards each year. While sales are estimated between $7 and $8 billion annually, according to the Greeting Card Association, many of these cards are now purchased in big box stores, such as Target and Walmart. Those living in small towns often don’t have access to these types of stores, at least not in their immediate vicinity. Providing the people of your town with a place to not only purchase cards but gifts as well is a prime retail opportunity. The variety and diversity of products you can carry are endless, which allows you the freedom to play around with your inventory until you find that special mix of products for your small town business. Plus, the profit margin on gift cards can be quite high, making this a potentially very lucrative business
